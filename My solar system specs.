I have 10Kw of Solar panels
Fronius Primo 8.2-1.
AlphaESS Smile G3-S5 20kw (4 x Smile-G2-S5-BAT)
Im with Amber Electric and have turned off SmartShift automation as im using EnergyManager.com.au
My system is AC coupled and therefore cannot curtail the Alpha Systems excess solar export.
NSW - Ausgrid network.

Whilst ive taken every precaution with this automation its up to the end user to do their own testing. I am not responsible if the magic smoke appears.
